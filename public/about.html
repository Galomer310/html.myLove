<h1>My love to you</h1>
<p>In love's embrace, a beauty divine,<br>
My heart's compass, my forever sign.<br>
With eyes that shimmer like stars at night,<br>
You fill my world with radiant light.<br>

Your smile, a sunbeam breaking through clouds,<br>
Melting my worries, erasing my doubts.<br>
In your presence, time finds its rhyme,<br>
A melody sweet, transcending all time.<br>

Your laughter, a melody of pure delight,<br>
In your arms, everything feels so right.<br>
Your touch, a gentle and soothing breeze,<br>
Bringing me comfort, putting my soul at ease.<br>

With each passing day, my love grows strong,<br>
A river of emotions, a current so long.<br>
You're the canvas of dreams, colors so bold,<br>
In your love's tapestry, my story is told.<br>

So here's to you, my love, my heart's true queen,<br>
In your love's garden, I am evergreen.<br>
Forever and always, by your side I'll stay,<br>
In this beautiful journey, come what may..</p>
